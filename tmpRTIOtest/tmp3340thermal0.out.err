Error -7 interpolating aerosol optical thickness to 355.000000 nm.
In the current implementation of aerosol_set_tau_at_wvl, it is required
that the internal wavelength range includes 355.000000 nm.
The range of the internal wavelength grid is from 550.000000 to 70000.000000 nm. 
Hope to change that in future!
