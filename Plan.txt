----------------------------------- MASTER PLAN -----------------------------------------

------------ Git Rutine ------
cd -> to folder
git status
git add -A              # or: git add <files/dirs>
git commit -m "<short note>"
git push


------------ Short-Term -------
- Read 1 hour first in the morning! 
- Make function to plot whole globe + mulitple swaths!
- Think about what to include on monday meeting ()
- CHECK ATMOSPHERE ACM-COM UNCERTAINTIES IS QUAITY STATUS CORRECT? IS ACTTUALYY ATMOSPHERE 1 MORE VALID THEN ATMOSPHERE 0????????
- Get mean-error in Buffer-Sensitivity, Ice-Habit-Sensitivity, AOD-thermal-Model-Sensitivity -> use in conclusion & abstract
- Write about CF-diff in Large-VS-Small-Buffer
- Make Add_Quantity IWC and LWP vs astitude!
- Make DISORT vs ACM-RT 1D
- Calculate all LWP and IWP for tables again! do not include LWP and IWP threshold!!
- Make CF-plot that follow what small and/or large 3D buffer see! 
    * Plot CF for Large- and for Small-Buffer! -> where they differ-> differnds librad_diff_flx large vs small 3D buffer
    * where 3D vs 1D RT differ as well i think!
- Select distingt large error (with souronding good errros) to study closer:
    * RUN MYSTIC and DISORT -> libRad_diff_flx
    * Plot many plots -> see something correlating?
    * errors regarding cloud-thikness?
    * 3D cloud anisotropy causing errors? -> can see better in Large vs Small Buffer and comparison to DISORT 
    * Info-Plot show correlation to where Flux-Errros is located?





- Select areas interessting to look at liquid- and ice-water-clouds
        - cloudfree areas
        - ice-cloud areas
        - liquid-cloud areas
        - liquid and ice cloud areas 
        - cloud altitude relevant?
    - MYISTIC vs (BMA-FLX, DISORT, ACM-RT 3D)
    - DISORT  vs (BMA-FLX, ACM-1D)
    - MYSTIC averaged vs DISORT averaged?
    - Make statistics (delta_F plots, means over 100x10 areas compared to BMA-FLX -> more representable to ESM?)


------------ Writing -----------
- Conseptual Framework of data->results
- Monte Carlo Noice 


------------ Coding --------------
- Function to calculate <F> (not mean diff!)
- Select cloudy areas with large variations:
    Look at: Mystic VS Disort, Mystic VS ACM-RT 3D, Mystic VS BMA-FLX



------- THINGS TO LOOK INTO ------
- Albedo VS Cloud-Fraction (ref: Griskey i think, look into)
- SWIA - Impact (compare against All-, Clear-, Pristine-Sky)
